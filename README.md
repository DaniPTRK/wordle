# wordle
A remake of the game "Wordle" using ncurses library in C.
  In order to play the actual game, you must open a Linux Terminal and compile the source code.
  The game has some restrictions on the size of the Linux Terminal window (at least 50 lines width x 45 lines height), 
so be sure to have a properly sized window before starting the game, otherwise you'll receive an error message.
